{{< figure src="/headshot.jpg" title="Me" >}}

Hi! I am Calvin-Khang Ta and am currently a PhD candidate at the University of California, Riverside. My current research interests are in generative modeling, vision language models, and 3D pose estimation. Additionally, I have professional and academic research experience in applying deep learning towards image restoration and video compression.
